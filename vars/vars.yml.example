# Example Variables File for Confluence Documentation Automation
# Copy this to vars/vars.yml and update with your actual values

# === PROJECT INFORMATION ===
project_name: "Your Project Name"
env: "Development"  # Options: Development, Staging, Production
database_url: "https://your-database.example.com"

# === CONFLUENCE CONFIGURATION ===
confluence_url: "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki"
confluence_space: "YOUR_SPACE_KEY"

# === SECURITY: CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT ===
# NEVER commit real credentials to version control!
#
# Recommended approaches:
# 1. Use ansible-vault to encrypt this entire file:
#    ansible-vault encrypt vars/vars.yml
#
# 2. Store credentials in a separate vault file:
#    confluence_auth: "{{ vault_confluence_auth }}"
#
# 3. Use environment variables (ideal for CI/CD):
#    confluence_auth: "{{ lookup('env', 'CONFLUENCE_AUTH_TOKEN') }}"
#
# 4. Use external secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.):
#    confluence_auth: "{{ lookup('vault', 'secret/confluence/auth') }}"
#
# For testing only (replace with actual base64 encoded user:token):
confluence_auth: "YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS_HERE"
