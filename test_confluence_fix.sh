echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "❌ OLD APPROACH (Broken for Remote Calls):"
echo "   publish:"
echo "     uses: ./.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml  # Only works locally"
echo ""
echo "✅ NEW APPROACH (Works for Both Local and Remote):"
echo "   publish:"
echo "     runs-on: ubuntu-latest"
echo "     steps:"
echo "       - name: Detect Repository Context"
echo "       - name: Checkout Scripts (always from redesigned-guacamole)" 
echo "       - name: Checkout Content (from calling repo if remote)"
echo "       - name: Run Confluence Publishing Inline"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Benefits:"
echo "   ✅ Works when called from any repository"
echo "   ✅ Automatically detects local vs remote context"
echo "   ✅ Handles missing secrets gracefully" 
echo "   ✅ Supports both dry-run and live publishing"
echo "   ✅ No dependency on external workflow files"
echo ""
echo "📋 Test Cases Covered:"
echo "   ✅ Local execution (same repo)"
echo "   ✅ Remote execution (different repo)"
echo "   ✅ Missing Confluence secrets (graceful failure/dry-run)"
echo "   ✅ Different repository owners"
