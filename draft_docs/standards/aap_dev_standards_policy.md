# AAP Development Standards and Environment Policy

## Document Information

- **Document Type**: Platform Policy
- **Audience**: Leadership, Platform Team, Development Teams
- **Effective Date**: TBD
- **Review Cycle**: Semi-Annual
- **Owner**: Platform Governance Team

## Purpose and Rationale

This policy establishes the framework for how automation development occurs within the Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. The primary objectives are to:

- Reduce configuration drift across environments
- Enforce governance and security standards
- Ensure consistent development practices
- Maintain audit trails and compliance
- Enable scalable automation delivery

## Development Environment Principles

### Standardized Tooling Stack

All automation development must utilize the approved tooling stack:

1. **Development Spaces (Dev Spaces)**
   - Containerized development environments
   - Consistent tooling and dependencies
   - Isolation from local development environments

2. **Ansible Navigator**
   - Primary execution interface
   - Execution Environment integration
   - Enhanced debugging and logging capabilities

3. **Execution Environments (EE)**
   - Containerized automation runtime
   - Version-controlled dependencies
   - Immutable execution context

4. **Molecule Testing Framework**
   - Infrastructure-as-code testing
   - Multi-scenario validation
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

5. **Pre-commit Framework**
   - Automated code quality checks
   - Policy enforcement at commit time
   - Integration with linting tools

### Environment Segregation

Development activities must follow the established environment hierarchy:

- **Development**: Individual developer workspaces and testing
- **Integration**: Team-level integration and validation
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
- **Production**: Live automation execution

## Execution Environment Management

### Build and Lifecycle Management

#### Build Cadence
- Monthly scheduled rebuilds for security updates
- Ad-hoc builds for critical updates or new requirements
- Emergency builds for security vulnerabilities

#### Tagging Strategy
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format)
- Date-based tags (YYYY.MM.DD) for tracking
- Environment-specific tags (dev, staging, prod)

#### Dependency Management
- All dependencies defined in ansible-builder specification
- Version pinning for production environments
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Approved package repositories only

### Image Registry and Distribution

- Central container registry (Quay.io or internal registry)
- Image signing and verification required
- Access controls based on environment and role
- Automated distribution to AAP instances

## Security Controls

### Secrets and Credential Management

#### Approved Methods
- OpenShift/Kubernetes secrets for Dev Spaces
- AAP Credential types for automation credentials
- External credential management systems (HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk)

#### Prohibited Practices
- Hardcoded credentials in playbooks or variables
- Local pip installations in shell environments
- Credential sharing between environments
- Unencrypted credential storage

### Access Controls

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all environments
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and cleanup

## Change Management Process

### Branching Strategy

#### Branch Types
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/**: Emergency production fixes
- **release/**: Release preparation

#### Branch Naming Convention
- feature/JIRA-123-brief-description
- hotfix/JIRA-456-critical-fix
- release/v1.2.0

### Pull Request Process

#### Requirements
- All automated checks must pass (linting, testing, security scans)
- Minimum two reviewer approvals
- Documentation updates for user-facing changes
- Test coverage for new functionality

#### Automated Validations
- YAML linting and formatting
- Ansible-lint rule compliance
- Molecule test execution
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Policy compliance checks

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

#### Linting Standards
- YAML lint compliance (yamllint)
- Ansible lint compliance (ansible-lint with custom rules)
- Documentation lint for markdown files
- Shell script validation (shellcheck)

#### Testing Requirements
- Molecule scenarios for infrastructure testing
- Unit tests for custom modules and filters
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance testing for large-scale automation

### Documentation Standards

#### Required Documentation
- README.md with usage instructions
- Role and playbook documentation
- Variable documentation with examples
- Troubleshooting guides
- Change logs

#### Documentation Format
- Markdown format for all documentation
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Consistent structure and formatting
- Version control for all documentation changes

## Enterprise Policy Alignment

### Compliance Integration

#### RBAC Integration
- Active Directory integration for authentication
- Role mapping to enterprise groups
- Regular access certification process
- Automated provisioning and deprovisioning

#### Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
- Inventory synchronization with enterprise CMDB
- Asset lifecycle tracking
- Change impact analysis
- Dependency mapping

#### Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging to Splunk or equivalent SIEM
- Audit trail for all automation activities
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Compliance reporting automation

### Data Governance

#### Data Classification
- Sensitive data handling procedures
- Data retention policies
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions
- Privacy and compliance requirements

#### Backup and Recovery
- Automated backup procedures
- Disaster recovery testing
- Business continuity planning
- Recovery time and point objectives

## Implementation and Enforcement

### Onboarding Process

New development teams must complete:
1. Platform training and certification
2. Security awareness training
3. Tool access provisioning
4. Initial project setup assistance

### Monitoring and Compliance

#### Automated Monitoring
- Policy compliance dashboards
- Automated compliance scanning
- Exception tracking and reporting
- Trend analysis and reporting

#### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly compliance assessments
- Annual policy review and updates
- Project-specific compliance audits
- Exception review and approval

### Non-Compliance Response
