platform_improvements_enablement:
  - "Identified key anti-patterns during discovery and pilot phases of our Ansible development capabilities. These findings are shaping how we mature development practices and build the right guardrails for delivery."
  - "Proposed a governed development framework that guides capability growth and structured story generation—focused on enabling teams rather than policing them."
  - "Introduced a Dev Spaces + remote EE workflow to standardize how we build, test, and execute automation in a secure, consistent way."
  - "Embedded linting, Molecule testing, and CI checks early in the loop to tighten feedback and improve reliability before anything reaches production."
  - "Defined and documented a clear EE lifecycle—build, sign, and promote—through Quay/PAH and AAP orgs, reducing friction and improving traceability."
  - "Established documentation-as-code practices for standards, governance, and reusable patterns, letting our content evolve alongside our code."
  - "Aligned every effort to our SVP’s automation goals: accelerating efficiency, improving reliability, enabling innovation, and fostering continuous improvement."
  - "Grounded all rollout work in the SVP’s four-phase implementation model—Discovery → Pilot → Scale → Institutionalize—to keep teams focused and supported at each stage."

windows_server_upgrade_automation:
  - "Facilitated discovery sessions with Server Operations to define an in-place Windows Server upgrade path (2016/2019 → 2022/2025)."
  - "Worked out the high-level upgrade flow, core automation components, and rough effort estimates for integration into our delivery pipeline."
  - "Server Ops will update the manual process documentation while we continue development in parallel, keeping focus on enabling delivery."
  - "Developers have successfully tested WinRM connectivity, confirming a clean foundation for Windows automation moving forward."

vmware_integration_enablement:
  - "Enabled VMware coding capabilities directly in Dev Spaces using our EE image with VMware collections preloaded."
  - "Team validated connectivity to the vSphere API—confirming authentication, inventory access, and a functional development loop."
  - "This replaces legacy, air-gapped installs on the old Ansible Core controller and finally gives us a scalable, supportable path for VMware automation."
  - "Sets the stage for future provisioning, snapshot, and server build workflows to run cleanly under AAP governance."
