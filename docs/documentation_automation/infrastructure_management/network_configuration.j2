# Network Configuration

## Overview

This document provides guidance for configuring network components within the Automation Hub infrastructure.

## Network Architecture

### Core Components
- Load balancers and proxies
- Firewall configurations
- DNS and routing tables
- Network segmentation policies

### Security Considerations
- Network access controls
- Traffic encryption standards
- Monitoring and logging requirements

## Configuration Procedures

### Load Balancer Setup
```yaml
load_balancer:
  type: application
  listeners:
    - port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      ssl_policy: ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01
  health_checks:
    enabled: true
    interval: 30
    timeout: 5
```

### Firewall Rules
```yaml
firewall_rules:
  inbound:
    - port: 22
      protocol: TCP
      source: management_network
    - port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      source: public
  outbound:
    - port: 80,443
      protocol: TCP
      destination: any
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Network Monitoring
- Bandwidth utilization tracking
- Latency measurements
- Connection health checks
- Security event monitoring

### Regular Maintenance
- Configuration backup procedures
- Update and patch management
- Performance optimization reviews
- Security assessment schedules

## Troubleshooting

### Network Connectivity Issues
1. Verify physical connections
2. Check routing configurations
3. Validate firewall rules
4. Test DNS resolution

### Performance Problems
1. Monitor bandwidth utilization
2. Check for network congestion
3. Review load balancer metrics
4. Analyze traffic patterns
