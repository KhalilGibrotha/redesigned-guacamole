# {{ organization_name }}
# {{ sub_organization_name }} - Platform Admin Guide

## 1. Introduction
**Purpose:** Define administrative responsibilities in {{ organization_name }}'s AAP deployment.  
**Scope:** Covers Execution Environments (EEs), job templates, RBAC, security, and compliance for {{ organization_name }}.

---

## 2. Infrastructure Overview
### AAP Architecture Overview
- Control Nodes (Orchestration)
- Execution Nodes (Playbook Execution)
- Load Balancer: {{ aap_load_balancer }}

### Networking Requirements
- Registry access for EE builds: {{ aap_registry_url }}
- RBAC via {{ identity_management_system }}

---

## 3. Execution Environment (EE) Management
### 3.1. Building a Custom EE
#### Define EE Build Configuration
- Base image
- Collections: {{ aap_preferred_galaxy_collections | join(', ') }}
- Python dependencies (e.g., boto3, requests)
- System dependencies (e.g., RPM packages)

#### Steps
1. Build the EE
2. Push EE to Registry
3. Register EE in AAP

### 3.2. Automating EE Builds (CI/CD)
- Use AAP Job Templates to trigger EE builds on updates.
- Automate registry sync to avoid stale images.

---

## 4. Platform Security & Governance
### RBAC Enforcement
- Role-based access control via {{ aap_rbac_provider }}
- No direct individual permissions

### Inventory & Credential Security
- Centralized credential storage: {{ aap_credential_storage }}
- Role-based credential usage restrictions

### Job Execution Policies
- Execution only within predefined environments
- Approval workflow for sensitive automation

---

## 5. Maintenance & Troubleshooting
### EE Build Issues
- Debugging execution-environment.yml errors
- Checking build logs

### Registry Sync Failures
- Ensuring connectivity to {{ aap_registry_url }}
- Automating periodic sync jobs

### RBAC/Access Errors
- Validating {{ identity_management_system }} group memberships
- Ensuring correct role assignments

### Container Logs & Debugging
- Accessing logs from execution nodes
- Reviewing job failures in AAP logs

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities
### 6.1 Overview
To maintain the integrity, security, and efficiency of {{ organization_name }}'s AAP, clearly defined roles and responsibilities ensure structured governance, technical execution, and compliance.

### 6.2 Key Roles
| Role | Responsibilities | Decision Authority | SME Area |
|------|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Principal Engineer & Architect (PEA)** | - Define AAP governance, policies, and architecture.<br>- Approve all runbooks, procedures, and best practices.<br>- Establish compliance, security, and operational standards.<br>- Align AAP with broader IT and business strategy. | Final authority on governance, architecture, and operational procedures. | Governance, architecture, security, compliance |
| **AAP Engineer** | - Implement AAP configurations, execute technical builds.<br>- Deploy and maintain Execution Environments (EEs).<br>- Troubleshoot job execution issues.<br>- Manage day-to-day platform operations. | Executes technical tasks within established governance. | Technical SME for AAP operations and configurations |
| **Platform Administrator** | - Manage platform-wide settings and user access.<br>- Ensure AAP is operational and compliant.<br>- Oversee inventory and credential security. | Administrative control over AAP infrastructure. | Platform maintenance, access control, security policies |
| **Platform Operator** | - Execute approved automation workflows.<br>- Report issues and provide operational feedback. | Executes but does not modify workflows. | Job execution and automation workflows |
| **Platform Auditor** | - Monitor compliance, security adherence, and audit logs.<br>- Ensure governance policies are being followed. | Read-only access for auditing and compliance. | Compliance, security adherence, reporting |

### 6.3 Governance and Decision-Making Authority
- Final approval on architecture, governance, and procedures resides with the Principal Engineer & Architect.
- Technical implementation of approved procedures and governance is the responsibility of the AAP Engineer.
- All changes, deployments, and modifications must follow the established approval workflow and security policies.

### 6.4 Approval Workflow
#### Significant Change Requests & New Implementations
- Changes impacting security, compliance, or architecture must be reviewed and approved by the Principal Engineer & Architect before execution.
- Examples include new governance frameworks, major RBAC modifications, or infrastructure-wide automation updates.

#### Minor Process or Workflow Modifications
- Updates that do not impact security, compliance, or architecture (e.g., minor optimizations, updates to non-governance job templates) may be reviewed and approved by the AAP Engineer or Platform Administrator.

#### Technical Deployments
- AAP Engineer executes approved tasks based on defined architecture and governance policies.

#### Compliance & Security Audits
- Conducted periodically by Platform Auditors to ensure adherence to security and operational guidelines.
