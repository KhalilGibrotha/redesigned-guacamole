# Automation OKR Reference Sheet  
**SEO Automation Platform – Reusable Objectives and Measurement Guidance**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines a reusable set of **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** that can be applied across any automation initiative.  
Each objective ties directly to the SVP’s strategic automation goals—**efficiency, reliability, innovation, and continuous improvement**—and follows the organizational implementation model:  
**Discovery → Pilot → Scale → Institutionalize.**

These OKRs are designed to be used during planning, story intake, and project evaluation to ensure consistency and measurable value across automation efforts.

---

## 2. General Automation OKRs

### **Objective 1 – Accelerate Efficiency Across Operations**

**Intent:**  
Replace repetitive, manual steps with automation to reduce toil and accelerate delivery.

**Measurement Guidance:**
- Capture baseline manual effort (time, frequency, team touchpoints).
- Track time saved per execution after automation deployment.
- Record reduction in number of manual tickets or approvals required.
- Log total runs executed automatically vs. manually.

---

### **Objective 2 – Improve Reliability and Consistency of Outcomes**

**Intent:**  
Ensure that automated workflows produce predictable, repeatable results across environments.

**Measurement Guidance:**
- Monitor automation job success/failure rate (from AAP logs).
- Track number of post-change incidents or rollbacks.
- Compare configuration drift before and after automation adoption.
- Record mean time to detect and remediate failures.

---

### **Objective 3 – Enable Innovation and Higher-Value Engineering Work**

**Intent:**  
Free engineers from routine execution so they can focus on optimization, design, and enablement.

**Measurement Guidance:**
- Estimate percentage of engineering time redirected to development or optimization.
- Count new capabilities or automation patterns produced per quarter.
- Track reuse rate of shared roles, collections, or templates.
- Record improvements in delivery velocity or feature throughput.

---

### **Objective 4 – Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement**

**Intent:**  
Embed automation practices into day-to-day operations and make improvement measurable and visible.

**Measurement Guidance:**
- Track number of process improvement or automation suggestions implemented.
- Survey user or stakeholder satisfaction with automation effectiveness.
- Measure documentation completeness and version control adoption.
- Maintain trend of recurring defects or manual exceptions.

---

### **Objective 5 – Standardize and Govern Automation Delivery**

**Intent:**  
Implement consistent patterns, controls, and governance around automation development and promotion.

**Measurement Guidance:**
- Track percentage of automation running from signed, versioned EEs.
- Measure compliance against internal standards and naming conventions.
- Monitor code review and testing coverage before promotion.
- Log exceptions or deviations approved by governance boards.

---

### **Objective 6 – Scale Adoption Through Repeatable Implementation Phases**

**Intent:**  
Ensure every new initiative follows the Discovery → Pilot → Scale → Institutionalize model.

**Measurement Guidance:**
- Identify phase for each automation story and track transitions between phases.
- Record success rate of pilots advancing to scale.
- Measure onboarding time for new teams adopting standard tooling.
- Track number of automation efforts formally institutionalized (supported, documented, and governed).

## 3. How to Use During Planning

1. **Select Objectives:** Choose one or two objectives that best align with the intent of the automation story or process.
2. **Define Measurement Approach:** Use relevant bullets from *Measurement Guidance* as acceptance criteria or discovery checklist items.
3. **Assign Lifecycle Phase:** Identify the current phase — *Discovery, Pilot, Scale, or Institutionalize* — and include it in story metadata or Jira labels.
4. **Track and Report:** Collect outcome metrics over time (e.g., time saved, reliability rate, adoption rate) for leadership reporting.

## 4. Example Application

| Example Automation Initiative | Primary Objective | Supporting Objective | Phase | Example Metrics |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Windows Server In-Place Upgrade Automation | Accelerate Efficiency | Improve Reliability | Pilot | Task time saved (hrs), Success rate %, Rollback count |
| VMware API Integration Enablement | Enable Innovation | Standardize Delivery | Discovery | Number of validated API calls, Onboarding time for team |
| Certificate Renewal Workflow (Venafi Integration) | Improve Reliability | Foster Continuous Improvement | Scale | Success rate %, Reduction in expired cert incidents |
| CIS Compliance Remediation Jobs | Standardize Delivery | Accelerate Efficiency | Institutionalize | Compliance %, Runtime reduction, Job adoption rate |

---

## 5. Summary

These OKRs create a consistent language for evaluating automation impact and maturity across all teams.  
By aligning each effort to measurable outcomes and defined lifecycle phases, we reinforce our strategic goals of **efficiency, reliability, innovation, and continuous improvement**, while enabling transparent reporting and continual growth of our automation ecosystem.
