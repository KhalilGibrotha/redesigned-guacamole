# CI/CD Templates - Work in Progress

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL TEMPLATES** ⚠️

These CI/CD templates are provided as starting points and have not been fully tested across all platforms and environments.

## Current Status
- Templates are syntactically correct but may need platform-specific customization
- Not all combinations of tools and environments have been tested
- May require adjustments for your specific infrastructure

## Before Using
1. Review and customize for your environment
2. Test in a non-production setting first
3. Verify all required tools and permissions are available
4. Adapt to your organization's standards and requirements

## Tested Core Functionality
The core Ansible automation that these templates call is fully tested:
- `make validate` - Complete validation suite
- `make lint` - YAML and Ansible linting
- `make security-check` - Security validation
- Core playbook functionality

## Recommendation
Start with a simple CI/CD configuration that just runs `make validate` and gradually add complexity as you verify each component works in your environment.
