# ShellCheck configuration for standalone shell scripts
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck

# Shell dialect to target (bash for modern scripts, sh for maximum compatibility)
shell=bash

# Production Script Considerations:
# Standalone shell scripts should follow strict standards for reliability,
# security, and maintainability. This configuration enables maximum checking
# while excluding only the most problematic false positives.

# Exclude only unavoidable false positives
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (can't find include files)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (false positives with complex scripts)
# SC2154: Variable is referenced but not assigned (false positives with inherited variables)

exclude=SC1091,SC2034,SC2154

# Keep ALL other checks enabled for maximum safety:
# ✅ SC2086: Quoting issues (IMPORTANT for security)
# ✅ SC2129: Redirect patterns (style and performance)
# ✅ SC2038: Find with xargs (reliability)
# ✅ SC2015: A && B || C patterns (logic errors)
# ✅ SC2044: For loops over find (reliability)
# ✅ SC2193: Comparison issues (logic errors)
# ✅ SC2081: Glob matching (correctness)

# Optional: Include directories for sourced files
# source-path=.:lib:scripts:../common

# Enable all available checks for production scripts
# enable=all

# Severity levels: error, warning, info, style
# Consider treating warnings as errors in production environments
# severity=error

# Output format for CI integration
# format=gcc
