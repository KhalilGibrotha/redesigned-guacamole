echo "❌ OLD LOGIC (Problematic for Remote Calls):"
echo "   if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then    # Looks in calling repo"
echo "     pip install -r requirements.txt  # Fails if not found"
echo "   fi"
echo ""
echo "✅ NEW LOGIC (Works for Both Local and Remote):"
echo "   if [ -f redesigned-guacamole/requirements.txt ]; then"
echo "     pip install -r redesigned-guacamole/requirements.txt  # Scripts repo"
echo "   else"
echo "     echo 'Installing minimal dependencies...'"
echo "   fi"
echo "   # Always ensure core dependencies"
echo "   pip install jinja2 pyyaml requests markdown beautifulsoup4"

echo "🛡️ Safety Features:"
echo "   ✅ No pip cache (avoids calling repo dependency conflicts)"
echo "   ✅ Always installs core Confluence publishing dependencies"
echo "   ✅ Graceful fallback when redesigned-guacamole/requirements.txt missing"
echo "   ✅ Detailed logging for debugging"
echo ""
echo "📋 Tested Scenarios:"
echo "   ✅ Scripts repo has requirements.txt (normal case)"
echo "   ✅ Scripts repo missing requirements.txt (fallback case)"
echo "   ✅ Remote calling repo without requirements.txt (no longer fails)"
