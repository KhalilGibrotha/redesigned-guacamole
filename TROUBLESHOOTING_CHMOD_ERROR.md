# Troubleshooting Confluence Publisher chmod Error

## Quick Fix Checklist

### 1. Verify Workflow Reference
In your `bug-free-fiesta/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, ensure you're using:
```yaml
uses: KhalilGibrotha/redesigned-guacamole/.github/workflows/ci-optimized.yml@main
```

### 2. Force Refresh GitHub Actions Cache
If you're still seeing the error, GitHub Actions might be using a cached version:
- Go to your workflow run
- Click "Re-run all jobs" to force a fresh execution
- This will pull the latest version of the workflow

### 3. Check for Multiple Workflow Calls
Make sure you're not accidentally calling multiple workflows that might include the old `publish-docs.yml`

### 4. Verify the Exact Error Location
The error should show which step is failing. Look for:
```
chmod: cannot access 'redesigned-guacamole/scripts/confluence_publisher.py': No such file or directory
```

### 5. Alternative: Use Specific Commit SHA
If caching persists, temporarily use a specific commit:
```yaml
uses: KhalilGibrotha/redesigned-guacamole/.github/workflows/ci-optimized.yml@<commit-sha>
```

## Recent Fixes Applied

✅ **ci-optimized.yml** - Removed chmod command (lines 1169-1191)
✅ **publish-docs.yml** - Removed chmod command (line 205)
✅ **Enhanced debugging** - Added script existence verification

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run the workflow** to see if the issue persists
2. **Check the exact error message** to confirm which step is failing
3. **Verify the workflow logs** show our enhanced debugging output

If the error continues, please share:
- The exact error message
- Which step is failing
- The workflow run URL

## Why This Error Occurs

The error happens when GitHub Actions tries to run:
```bash
chmod +x redesigned-guacamole/scripts/confluence_publisher.py
```

But the file either:
- Doesn't exist at that path
- Isn't accessible due to permissions
- The path is wrong due to checkout issues

**Our fix**: Remove the `chmod` entirely since Python scripts called with `python3 script.py` don't need execute permissions.
