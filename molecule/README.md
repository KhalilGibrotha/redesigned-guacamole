# Molecule Testing - Work in Progress

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE** ⚠️

This Molecule testing configuration is currently work-in-progress and has not been fully validated.

## Current Status
- Configuration files exist but may need additional setup
- Docker driver dependencies may require installation
- Tests have not been comprehensively validated across all environments

## Before Using
1. Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. Install Molecule with Docker support: `pipx install molecule[docker]`
3. Test in a safe environment before relying on results
4. Consider this experimental until further validation

## Alternative Testing
For reliable testing, use the core validation commands:
- `make validate` - Comprehensive validation suite
- `make lint` - YAML and Ansible linting  
- `make test` - Syntax validation
- `make security-check` - Security scanning

These core features are fully tested and production-ready.
