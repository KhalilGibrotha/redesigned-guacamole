# Full Codebase Linting Trigger

This file triggers Super Linter to scan ALL files in the repository instead of just changed files.

## How it Works:
- When this file exists, the CI/CD pipeline automatically enables `VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE=true`
- Super Linter will analyze every file in the repository, not just the ones changed in the current commit/PR
- Useful for comprehensive code quality audits or after configuration changes

## Usage:
1. Create this file: `touch .lint-all-files`
2. Commit and push: `git add .lint-all-files && git commit -m "trigger: enable full codebase linting" && git push`
3. The next CI/CD run will scan all files

## When to Use:
- After updating linter configurations
- For comprehensive code quality audits
- When onboarding new linting rules
- For release preparation
- After major refactoring

## To Disable:
Simply delete this file and commit the change.
